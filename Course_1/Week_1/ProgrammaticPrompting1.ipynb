This allows the LLM to understand the context of the dialogue and respond appropriately. The roles include:\n",

        "  * “system”: Provides the model with initial instructions, rules, or configuration for how it should behave throughout the session. This message is not part of the “conversation” but sets the ground rules or context (e.g., “You will respond in JSON.”).\n",
        "  * “user”: Represents input from the user. This is where you provide your prompts, questions, or instructions.\n",
        "  * “assistant”: Represents responses from the AI model. You can include this role to provide context for a conversation that has already started or to guide the model by showing sample responses. These messages are interpreted as what the “model” said in the passt.\n",
        "3. We specify the model using the provider/model format (e.g., “openai/gpt-4o”)\n",
